- Hello, Iâ€™m Keenan Nicholson
- About me: I grew up on the Sunshine Coast of British Columbia and in 2007 moved to Newfoundland where I received a post-secondary certificate from College of the North Atlantic in Power Engineering: 4th Class in 2015. In 2016 I transfered to Memorial University of Newfoundland and in May 2020 I received my Bachelor of Science with a major in Computational Mathematics. In 2021 I decided to further my education by pursuing a degree in Computer Science with a minor in Geography. In my free time I enjoy almost any outdoor activity such as hiking or snowshoeing with my dog Goose, canoeing, kayaking and especially camping :-)
