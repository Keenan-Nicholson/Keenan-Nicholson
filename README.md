- Hi, Iâ€™m @Keenan-Nicholson
- about me: I gew up on the Sunshine Coast of British Columbia and moved to Newfoundland in 2007 where I attended high school until graduating in 2014.
From there I received a post-secondary certificate from College of the North Atlantic in Power Engineering: 4th Class in 2015 and transfered to
Memorial University of Newfoundland in 2016. In May 2020 I received my Bachelor of Science in computational mathematics and decided to use that knowledge
to persue a degree in computer science.
